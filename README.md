PROYECTOS DE MACHINE LEARNING Y DATA ANALYTICS

1. Gold Price Data : Historically, gold had been used as a form of currency in various parts of the world including the USA. In present times, precious metals like gold are held with central banks of all countries to guarantee re-payment of foreign debts, and also to control inflation which results in reflecting the financial strength of the country. Recently, emerging world economies, such as China, Russia, and India have been big buyers of gold, whereas the USA, SoUSA, South Africa, and Australia are among the big seller of gold.
Forecasting rise and fall in the daily gold rates can help investors to decide when to buy (or sell) the commodity. But Gold prices are dependent on many factors such as prices of other precious metals, prices of crude oil, stock exchange performance, Bonds prices, currency exchange rates, etc.
The challenge of this project is to accurately predict the future adjusted closing price of Gold ETF across a given period of time in the future. The problem is a regression problem, because the output value which is the adjusted closing price in this project is continuous value.

3. 🍻 Beer Distribution Route Optimization : This project aims to optimize beer distribution routes to maximize efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. Utilizing geospatial analysis techniques, linear programming, and potentially machine learning, the project seeks to determine the optimal sequence of visits to points of sale to minimize total travel distance or total travel time, considering various constraints such as operating hours, vehicle capacity, and service time at each point.

4. 🍎 Distribution of Food Products to Different Stores in Top Districts of Lima : This project focuses on planning and executing an effective distribution strategy for food products to various stores in the top districts of Lima. Through the use of data analysis, demand forecasting, and optimization modeling, the aim is to ensure that the right products reach the right stores at the right time. This will help maintain optimal inventory levels, minimize product loss due to expiration, and ensure customer satisfaction.
